# AI Core Dynamic Capability Runtime v2

This version fixes the previous skeleton behavior.

## Changes in v2

1. UI
   - User input is shown on the right side.
   - System/runtime messages are shown on the left side.
   - Smaller console-like font.
   - Human review supports Approve / Reject / Modify.

2. Core
   - Capability readiness is not treated as the node result.
   - After a capability is ready, the node is actually executed by a generic node runner.

3. Human Review
   - Approve: continue the workflow.
   - Reject: enter a reason and retry the current node.
   - Modify: edit the JSON result and continue with the modified value.

4. Input Parsing
   - The input parsing node performs real structural parsing.
   - It outputs:
     - language
     - intent_type
     - tasks
     - missing_information
     - required_capabilities
     - safety_notes
     - original_input
